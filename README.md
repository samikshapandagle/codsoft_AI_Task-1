# Chatbot
## Overview
This repository contains the code and resources for an intelligent chatbot built using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The chatbot is designed to understand and respond to user queries in real-time across various domains. It is built using Python and leverages machine learning libraries such as nltk, spaCy, and scikit-learn for language processing and response generation.

# Features
 1.Natural Language Understanding: Processes user input to extract intent and entities using tokenization, stemming, and vectorization techniques.
 2.Contextual Responses: Provides accurate and context-aware responses, improving the conversation flow.
 3.Extensible Framework: Easily customizable to integrate with external APIs, databases, or enhance with additional functionalities.
 4.Machine Learning: Incorporates algorithms for text classification and similarity matching, enabling more intelligent and adaptive responses.
# Technology Stack
Language: Python
NLP Libraries: nltk, spaCy
Machine Learning: scikit-learn, TfidfVectorizer, cosine_similarity
Other Tools: Flask or FastAPI for backend implementation, SQLite or MongoDB for data storage.
